# Airfoil Self_Noise Prediction

![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53497388/116295212-d65f3a80-a766-11eb-9591-741fa12b6846.gif)

Using this ML model, you can predict the aerodynamics noise generated by an airfoil using different Machine Learning algorithm such as **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, **K Nearest Neighbor**, and **Linear Regression**. To train this model, I used [**this NASA dataset**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/airfoil+self-noise), obtained from a series of aerodynamics and acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections. The web application is available [here](https://share.streamlit.io/masoud-ghasemian/airfoil_self_noise/airfoil-app.py). To use this web application, please enter the values for **Frequency**, **Angle of Attack**, **Chord Length**,  **Freestream Velocity**, and **Displacement** using slidbar. Then choose the Machine Learning model and hit the **Predict** button.
